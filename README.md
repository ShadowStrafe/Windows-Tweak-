This utility is a compilation of Windows tasks I perform on each Windows system I use. It is meant to streamline *installs*, debloat with *tweaks*, troubleshoot with *config*, and fix Windows *updates*. I am extremely picky about any contributions to keep this project clean and efficient.

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

Winutil must be run in Admin mode because it performs system-wide tweaks. To achieve this, run PowerShell as an administrator. Here are a few ways to do it:

1. **Start menu Method:**
   - Right-click on the start menu.
   - Choose "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" (for Windows 10) or "Terminal (Admin)" (for Windows 11).

### Launch Command

#### Stable Branch (Recommended)

```ps1
irm "https://christitus.com/win" | iex
```
